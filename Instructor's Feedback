GENERAL FEEDBACK:
I appreciate your honesty in the reflections and don't worry, 
I can see and recognize the hard work that you're putting in. 
It's really fun knowing that you enjoyed the activities.  
Some of the bonus parts that you did really stuck out (cutie nung bug). 

To organize your repo further, kindly put all the test images in a folder, 
and your results in another, such that the report and the code are what's available when clicking the activity folder. 

Good work, Genesis!
